BarFly was created to be similar to Yelp, but instead of it being so generalized and multiple categories, this would center on one serach term: bars!
Eventually this would implement a map that would take in an address given by the user and would output set number of bars within a certain mile radius

Each link is self-explanatory.
Bar List would show the different bars inside the database, which can then be clicked on and would be taken to that bars' information, such as rating and location. 
Add A Bar would take you to a form that would allow you to enter in a bars' name, location, rating, aliases(such as tiki or lounge), and also ask for a img of the bar itself.
Once you click on a bar and its information is presented, there will be a few buttons that allow you to either edit or delete that bar. Also includes a homepage button.
