BarFly was created to be similar to Yelp, but instead of it being so generalized and multiple categories, this would center on one serach term: bars!
Eventually this would implement a map that would take in an address given by the user and would output set number of bars within a certain mile radius

Each link is self-explanatory.
Bar List would show the different bars inside the database, which can then be clicked on and would be taken to that bars' information, such as rating and location. 
Add A Bar would take you to a form that would allow you to enter in a bars' name, location, rating, aliases(such as tiki or lounge), and also ask for a img of the bar itself.
Once you click on a bar and its information is presented, there will be a few buttons that allow you to either edit or delete that bar. Also includes a homepage button.

The designin the future would hopefully look somewhat similar to the yelp, the landing page a single search bar. After entering an address, their would be a mpa that would have a a heat chart marked on each bar's location. The heat chart would represent bar sales that night, keeping a real-time representation of what was going on that night, darker shades of red meaning more sales and people while blue indicated lower sales and less people. Below the map would be a small dropdown list of bars that if clicked would list certain details, such as hours open, website, and any specials that would be available. Keeping a simple design, it would have a few pictures that would change every 30 seconds highlighting certain key features.
